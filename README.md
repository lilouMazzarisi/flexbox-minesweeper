# Challenge: Flexing your CSS muscles
## Minesweeper
**Exercise**
We all remember those little games we have/had on our windows computers. Pinball, Patience, Minesweeper, ... Well, today we are just going to make just that. A Minesweeper! Now, don't worry, all I want it a static moment of the game, similar to the one displayed below.

You don't have to make an exact copy of the minefield, but try to have the following:

Borders made by using CSS only.
Little squares that will represent the field
Lines that divide the field
Bombs
Numbers
Make a minefield that looks like the image below, using Flexbox.
(You don't need to make an exact copy!)
(Does not have to be responsive!)

*Note: The minefield should be centred on the web page!*
